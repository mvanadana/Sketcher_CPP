# Assignment 10
## Sequential Containers Part 2
### Overview
This assignment involves use of sequential container deque 
The main objective here is to optimize the code by transitioning to the utilization of the std::deque container for storing triangles.

### Update Code
1. Substituted all instances of std::vector<Triangle> with std::deque<Triangle> within the Reader class.
2. This alteration signifies the adoption of std::deque for the storage of triangles, offering a more adaptable and flexible container choice for managing the data.
