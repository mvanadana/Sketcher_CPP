# Assignment3
# File Handling in C++ Part1
## Overview
This assignment involves file handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file.
The implementation is split between two files: Reader.cpp and Writer.cpp. 
The tasks include using the getline() function, utilizing istringstream for string parsing, creating Point3D objects, 
and populating a vector of Triangle objects and to read only vertex value from .stl file.

### Implementation
1.Implemented getline() function in getTriangles() in location /Assignment3/src/Reader.cpp.
2.Used an istringstream to parse the string in location  /Assignment3/src/Reader.cpp.
3.Taken all values and pass each (x, y, z) values to the point3D class object in location /Assignment3/src/Reader.cpp.
4.Added that object in the Triangle class type vector in location /Assignment3/src/Reader.cpp. Used a range-for loop to print out the data from each object in write() function in location/Assignment3/src/Writer.cpp.
